I want to see how far I'm able to take the existing technology on actually improving my own performance

# MY GOALS FOR THIS PROJECT

I want to be able to help people with technology. I have not yet seen many people conserned about the accessibility of it all though, that is why I am doing this right now. I am going to learn all of the things of accessibility that are relevant to me first (web readability, application usability, etc.) All of the important things that I learn along the way that might help me in the future to help myself will be listed here in some form. This project is supposed to eventually become a toolkit of helpers that I can then implement in some other code later. The purpose is to help the population of people that is growing older and older.
